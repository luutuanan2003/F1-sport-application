# F1-sport-application

This is my lastest application that I have developed using Java and Android Studio environment. 
Inside the source code, you just need to modified your Manifest file to look exactly like mine and copy the .xml files in the layout folders and the .java files to run it.

Application Description:
The app is all about Formula 1, a competitive form of motor racing, I will have a main screen for some basic information and users can choose to move to other 2 activities. 
Activity #1 would be a game where you can test your reaction against Formula 1 drivers; My idea of the game is to have the player hit the go button when the light goes from red, yellow and green, the timer will be started when the light turns green and from there their reaction will be timed and 
the result will be compared against Formula 1 drivers (the users can choose whether or not to try again or read more about the driver history). 
When they choose to read more about the driver, Activity #2 will start and show the history of the drivers their score for the season currently, etc. 

NOTED: I'm using API version of Lolipop in the IDE and the complier SDK / target SDK to be 34.
